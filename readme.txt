DEV NOTES:
- Is PlayerAchievement.cs needed?
- Is Base/Game/Players/Badges/Badge.cs needed?
- IDEA show how long it took to log a player in? start stopwatch at start of packet processing.
- Replace "SELECT *" with only columns that are needed
- Achievement is just hardcoded as 100, read it from user_stats (Player.cs) on new PlayData
- Make PlayerUtility class for achievements, quests, relationships, mutedUsers, etc..
